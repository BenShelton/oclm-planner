## Request Access

If you would like your own version of this for your congregation's use feel free to [email me](mailto:bensheltonjones@gmail.com) and I will provide a test version of the website for you to try out first.

If you are happy then I can set up your own version based on your congregation's preferences for no charge.

Please note that although anyone can request access to the test website, only the elder in charge of organising the OCLM meeting is able to request one to be set up.

## Setup Your Own Version

If you're a developer and would like to setup your own version then feel free. If you need assistance I'd be happy to help. Note that if you do make your own branch of this project then it _must_ be open source in accordance with the project license.

## Support & Development

If you find a bug or would like to request a new feature, feel free to look through the [Issues](https://github.com/BenShelton/oclm-planner/issues) page first to see if it has already been requested. If not please file a new issue.
